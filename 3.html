      A script is program code that doesn’t need pre-processing
       (e.g. compiling) before being run. In the context
       of a Web browser, scripting usually refers to program code
       written in JavaScript that is executed by the browser when
       a page is downloaded,
      or in response to an event triggered by the user.
